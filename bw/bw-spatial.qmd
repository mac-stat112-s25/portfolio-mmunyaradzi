#| fig-alt:"This choropleth map visualizes the percentage of votes for the Republican candidate in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election across states (excluding Washington, D.C.). States are color-coded into categories ranging from 0% to 100% Republican vote share, using a red-to-blue gradient. Darker red shades represent higher Republican vote percentages, while darker blue shades indicate lower percentages."
