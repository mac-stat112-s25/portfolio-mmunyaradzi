    "text": "11.2 New stuff\nThus far, we’ve been studying one variable at a time, using univariate plots. But once we get a sense of how individual variables behave on their own, our questions often turn to relationships among variables. For example, in our hikes data:\n\nHow much time does it take to complete a hike? ——&gt; How is time related to a hike’s elevation? What about its length?\nHow does difficult rating vary from hike to hike? ——-&gt; How is difficulty rating related to a hike’s ascent?\n\n\n11.2.1 Exploring relationships\nExploring univariate patterns often sparks follow-up questions about relationships between 2+ variables. Often, but not always, variables take on specific roles:\n\n\nresponse variable: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (time to complete a hike)\n\npredictors: variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (a hike’s elevation or length)\n\nVisualizations can help explore:\n\nrelationship trends (direction and form)\nrelationship strength (degree of variability from the trend)\n\noutliers in the relationship\n\nEXAMPLE 3\nFor each pair of variables below, sketch on paper a visualization of their relationship. Focus on general viz process, don’t worry about the exact details. The data here are totally made up.\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs 9am temperature (predictor)\n\n\ndata.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 15), temp_9am = c(14, 18, 15, 13, 11, 11))\n\n  temp_3pm temp_9am\n1       24       14\n2       26       18\n3       20       15\n4       15       13\n5       15       11\n6       15       11\n\n\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs location (predictor)\n\n\nweather &lt;- data.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 0, 40, 60, 57, 44, 51, 75),\n                      location = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 6))\nweather\n\n   temp_3pm location\n1        24        A\n2        26        A\n3        20        A\n4        15        A\n5        15        A\n6         0        A\n7        40        B\n8        60        B\n9        57        B\n10       44        B\n11       51        B\n12       75        B\n\n\nThink: How might we modify the below density plot of temp_3pm to distinguish between locations?\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp_3pm)) +\n      geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrain_today (the response) and location (the predictor)\n\n\nweather &lt;- data.frame(rain_today = c(\"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\"),\n                        location = c(rep(\"A\", 7), rep(\"B\", 5)))\n    weather\n\n   rain_today location\n1          no        A\n2          no        A\n3          no        A\n4          no        A\n5         yes        A\n6          no        A\n7         yes        A\n8          no        B\n9         yes        B\n10        yes        B\n11         no        B\n12        yes        B\n\n\nThink: How might we modify the below bar plot of location to distinguish between days on which it did or didn’t rain?\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location)) +\n      geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.2 General guidance for building bivariate plots\nAs with univariate plots, an appropriate visualization for the relationship between 2 variables depends upon whether the variables are quantitative or categorical. In general:\n\nEach quantitative variable requires a new axis (or a quantitative scale if we run out of axes).\nEach categorical variable requires a new way to “group” the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc)\nFor visualizations in which overlap in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.",

Construct a plot of repub_pct_20.\nNotice that the distribution of Republican support from county to county is slightly left skewed or negatively skewed.\nWhat follow-up questions do you have?\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check\nBelow is a scatterplot of the Republican support in 2020 vs 2016.

Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(x= median_age, y= repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(x= median_rent, y= repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\nThis is not a good relationship because it does not show any relationship and points are plotted against each other\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\nThere is a high support that decreases by state from red to purple to blue.\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\n# colors don't match, two of the plots are obscured\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\n# enables us to manually enter colors to fill\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\n# helps with transparent fills\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?!\n# presents plots in separate facets\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible? *crowds and obscures important info*\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best? density plots\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? show better vizulaization of data\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? may obscure some details of data distribution esp when comparing multiple groups \nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill= winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"skyblue\",\"pink\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#adjusted\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play? *historical is x-axis while winner is determined by scale of fill*\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why?\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?",

But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state. Since repub_pct_20 is quantitative and state_abbr is categorical, we could make a density plot of repub_pct_20 for each state.

The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\n# ggplot\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\nBimodal shape, suggesting that one group/cluster performed higher and another cluster performed low. The range is between is between 840 and 1120\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y= sat)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method= lm, se= F, color= \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y= salary)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method= lm, se= F, color= \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = salary)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill= fracCat)) +\n  geom_density(alpha= 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?",

    "text": "12.2 Exercises (optional)\nExercise 6: Heat Maps\nAs usual, we’ve only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let’s start with a heat map.\nPart a\nRun the chunks below. Check out the code, but don’t worry about every little detail! NOTES:\n\nThis is not part of the ggplot() grammar, making it a bit complicated.\nIf you’re curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (#) and check out what happens!\nIn the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).\nYou can also play with the color scheme. Type ?cm.colors in the console to learn about various options.\nWe’ll improve the plot later, so don’t spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.\n\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\nPart b\nIn the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The final plot includes a dendrogram which further indicates clusters of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.\nPutting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?\nExercise 7: Star plots\nLike heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!\nPart a\nConstruct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a “pie”, with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable’s value is in that state. For example:\n\nCheck out Minnesota. How does Minnesota’s education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?\nWhat states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?\n\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)\n\nPart b\nFinally, let’s plot the state stars by geographic location! What new insight do you gain here?!\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location\n  key.loc = c(-110, 28),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)",

Filtering joins keep only certain observations in one dataset (like filter()), not based on rules related to any variables in the dataset, but on the observations that exist in another dataset. This is useful when we merely care about the membership or non-membership of an observation in the other dataset, not the raw data itself.\nExample 5\nIn our example data, suppose enrollments_1 only included courses being taught in the Theater building:\n\n\nstudents_1 |&gt; \n  semi_join(enrollments_1)\n\n  student    class\n1       A STAT 101\n2       B GEOL 101\n\n\n\nWhat did this do?

You get an error! Identify the problem by reviewing the error message and the datasets we’re trying to join.\n\n# eval = FALSE: don't evaluate this chunk when knitting. it produces an error.\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2)\n\nPart b\nThe problem is that course name, the key or variable that links these two datasets, is labeled differently: class in the students_2 data and course in the enrollments_2 data. Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\n# its labeled as class in one dataset and as course in the other hence the join_by(class == course)\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(class == course))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# join_by(\"left data key\" == \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(course == class))\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info.

BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable as a key. What are grade.x and grade.y?\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, join_by(class == class))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\ncontact |&gt; \n  anti_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    B    grand  89\n2    C snelling  43\n\n# 2.

In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\n\nsid = student ID\n\ngrade = student’s grade\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\ndept = department\n\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\n\nsem = semester\n\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\n\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data?\ndim(grades)\n\n[1] 5844    3\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data?\ndim(courses)\n\n[1] 1718    6\n\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session2047    g   100 FA2001     12 inst436\n2 session2047    m   100 FA2001     28 inst436\n\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined. NOTE: There’s no joining to do here!\n\ncourses_combined &lt;- courses |&gt; \ngroup_by(sessionID) |&gt; \nsummarize(enroll = sum(enroll))\n\n# Check that this has 1695 rows and 2 columns\ndim(courses_combined)\n\n[1] 1695    2\n\n\nPart b\nLet’s first examine the question of class size from the administration’s viewpoint. To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\n\n\ncourses_combined |&gt; \n  summarize(median(enroll))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `median(enroll)`\n             &lt;int&gt;\n1               18\n\n\nPart c\nBut how big are classes from the student perspective? To this end, calculate the median class size for each individual student. Once you have the correct output, store it as student_class_size. THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\nPart d\nThe median class size varies from student to student. To get a sense for the typical student experience and range in student experiences, construct and discuss a histogram of the median class sizes experienced by the students.\n\n# ggplot(student_class_size, aes(x = ___)) + \n#   geom___()\n\nExercise 5: Narrowing in on classes\nPart a\nShow data on the students that enrolled in session1986. THINK FIRST: Which of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nPart b\nBelow is a dataset with all courses in department E:\n\ndept_E &lt;- courses |&gt; \n  filter(dept == \"E\")\n\nWhat students enrolled in classes in department E? (We just want info on the students, not the classes.)\nExercise 6: All the wrangling\nUse all of your wrangling skills to answer the following prompts! THINK FIRST:\n\nThink about what tables you might need to join (if any). Identify the corresponding variables to match.\nYou’ll need an extra table to convert grades to grade point averages:\n\n\ngpa_conversion &lt;- tibble(\n  grade = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"C+\", \"C\", \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"NC\", \"AU\", \"S\"), \n  gp = c(4.3, 4, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.7, 2.3, 2, 1.7, 1.3, 1, 0.7, 0, NA, NA)\n)\n\ngpa_conversion\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 2\n   grade    gp\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 A+      4.3\n 2 A       4  \n 3 A-      3.7\n 4 B+      3.3\n 5 B       3  \n 6 B-      2.7\n 7 C+      2.3\n 8 C       2  \n 9 C-      1.7\n10 D+      1.3\n11 D       1  \n12 D-      0.7\n13 NC      0  \n14 AU     NA  \n15 S      NA  \n\n\nPart a\nHow many total student enrollments are there in each department? Order from high to low.\nPart b\nWhat’s the grade-point average (GPA) for each student?\nPart c\nWhat’s the median GPA across all students?\nPart d\nWhat fraction of grades are below B+?\nPart e\nWhat’s the grade-point average for each instructor? Order from low to high.\nPart f\nCHALLENGE: Estimate the grade-point average for each department, and sort from low to high. NOTE: Don’t include cross-listed courses. Students in cross-listed courses could be enrolled under either department, and we do not know which department to assign the grade to. HINT: You’ll need to do multiple joins.",

    "text": "15.2 Reshaping Data\nThere are two general types of reshaped data:\n\naggregate data\nFor example, using group_by() with summarize() gains aggregate information about our observations but loses data on individual observations.\nraw data, reshaped\nWe often want to retain all information on individual observations, but need to reshape it in order to perform the task at hand.\n\nEXAMPLE 4: reshape it with your mind\nLet’s calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species. Since penguin_avg is small, we could do these calculations by hand. But this doesn’t scale up to bigger datasets.\n\nSketch out (on paper, in your head, anything) how this data would need to be reshaped, without losing any information, in order to calculate the differences in average body mass using our wrangling verbs. Make it as specific as possible, with column labels, entries, correct numbers, etc.\nIdentify the units of observation.\n\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\nWider vs Longer formats\nMaking our data longer or wider reshapes the data, changing the units of observation while retaining all raw information:\n\nMake the data longer, i.e. combine values from multiple variables into 1 variable. EXAMPLE: 1999 and 2000 represent two years. We want to combine their results into 1 variable without losing any information.\n\n\n\nMake the data wider, i.e. spread out the values across new variables. EXAMPLE: cases and pop represent two categories within type. To compare or combine their count outcomes side-by-side, we can separate them into their own variables.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5: pivot wider\nBecause it’s a small enough dataset to examine all at once, let’s start with our penguin_avg data:\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\nWith the goal of being able to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species, let’s make the dataset wider. That is, let’s get one row per species with separate columns for the average body mass by sex. Put this code into a chunk and run it:\n\npenguin_avg |&gt; \npivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Wider\n\n\n\n\n\nnames_from = the variable whose values we want to separate into their own columns, i.e. where we want to get the new column names from\n\n\nvalues_from = which variable to take the new column values from\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\nWhat are the units of observation?\nDid we lose any information when we widened the data?\nUse the wide data to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species.\nEXAMPLE 6: Pivot longer\nLet’s store our wide data:\n\npenguin_avg_wide &lt;- penguin_avg |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\npenguin_avg_wide\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\n\n\nSuppose we wanted to change this data back to a longer format. In general, this happens when some variables (here female and male) represent two categories or values of some broader variable (here sex), and we want to combine them into that 1 variable without losing any information. Let’s pivot_longer():\n\n# We can either communicate which variables we WANT to collect into a single column (female, male)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(female, male), names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n# Or which variable(s) we do NOT want to collect into a single column (sex)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = -species, names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Longer\n\n\n\n\n\ncols = the columns (variables) to collect into a single, new variable. We can also specify what variables we don’t want to collect\n\nnames_to = the name of the new variable which will include the names or labels of the collected variables\n\nvalues_to = the name of the new variable which will include the values of the collected variables\n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\nWhat are the units of observation?\nDid we lose any information when we lengthened the data?\nWhy did we put the variables in quotes “” here but not when we used pivot_wider()?\nEXAMPLE 7: Practice\nLet’s make up some data on the orders of 2 different customers at 3 different restaurants:\n\nfood &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 3),\n  restaurant = rep(c(\"Shish\", \"FrenchMeadow\", \"DunnBros\"), 2),\n  order = c(\"falafel\", \"salad\", \"coffee\", \"baklava\", \"pastry\", \"tea\")\n)\nfood\n\n  customer   restaurant   order\n1        A        Shish falafel\n2        A FrenchMeadow   salad\n3        A     DunnBros  coffee\n4        B        Shish baklava\n5        B FrenchMeadow  pastry\n6        B     DunnBros     tea\n\n\nThe units of observation in food are customer / restaurant combinations. Wrangle this data so that the units of observation are customers, spreading the restaurants into separate columns.\nConsider 2 more customers:\n\nmore_food &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = c(\"C\", \"D\"),\n  Shish = c(\"coffee\", \"maza\"),\n  FrenchMeadow = c(\"soup\", \"sandwich\"),\n  DunnBros = c(\"cookie\", \"coffee\")\n)\nmore_food\n\n  customer  Shish FrenchMeadow DunnBros\n1        C coffee         soup   cookie\n2        D   maza     sandwich   coffee\n\n\nWrangle this data so that the 3 restaurant columns are combined into 1, hence the units of observation are customer / restaurant combinations.",

It might help to think about what you’d need to complete the plotting frame:\nggplot(sleep_wide, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, color = ___))\nPart c\nHow can you obtain the dataset you sketched in part b?\n\njust using sleep_wide\n\npivot_longer()\npivot_wider()\n\n\n# For cols, try 2 appproaches: using - and starts_with\nsleep_wide %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject, names_to = \"day\", values_to = \"reaction_time\")\n\n# A tibble: 180 × 3\n   Subject day   reaction_time\n     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     308 day_0          250.\n 2     308 day_1          259.\n 3     308 day_2          251.\n 4     308 day_3          321.\n 5     308 day_4          357.\n 6     308 day_5          415.\n 7     308 day_6          382.\n 8     308 day_7          290.\n 9     308 day_8          431.\n10     308 day_9          466.\n# ℹ 170 more rows\n\n#second option\nsleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"day\"), names_to = \"day\", values_to = \"reaction_time\")\n\n# A tibble: 180 × 3\n   Subject day   reaction_time\n     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     308 day_0          250.\n 2     308 day_1          259.\n 3     308 day_2          251.\n 4     308 day_3          321.\n 5     308 day_4          357.\n 6     308 day_5          415.\n 7     308 day_6          382.\n 8     308 day_7          290.\n 9     308 day_8          431.\n10     308 day_9          466.\n# ℹ 170 more rows\n\n\nExercise 2: Pivot longer\nTo plot reaction time by day for each subject, we need to reshape the data into a long format where each row represents a subject/day combination. Specifically, we want a dataset with 3 columns and a first few rows that look something like this:\n\n\nSubject\nday\nreaction_time\n\n\n\n308\n0\n249.56\n\n\n308\n1\n258.70\n\n\n308\n2\n250.80\n\n\n\nPart a\nUse pivot_longer() to create the long-format dataset above. Show the first 3 lines (head(3)), which should be similar to those above. Follow-up: Thinking forward to plotting reaction time vs day for each subject, what would you like to fix / change about this dataset?\n\n# For cols, try 2 appproaches: using - and starts_with\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"day\"),\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\") \n\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject day   reaction_time\n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     308 0              250.\n2     308 1              259.\n3     308 2              251.\n4     308 3              321.\n5     308 4              357.\n6     308 5              415.\n\n\nPart b\nRun this chunk:\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\")\n\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject day   reaction_time\n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     308 0              250.\n2     308 1              259.\n3     308 2              251.\n4     308 3              321.\n5     308 4              357.\n6     308 5              415.\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nBesides putting each argument on a different line for readability and storing the results, what changed in the code?\nHow did this impact how the values are recorded in the day column?\nPart c\nUsing sleep_long, construct a line plot of reaction time vs day for each subject. This will look goofy no matter what you do. Why? HINT: look back at head(sleep_long). What class or type of variables are Subject and day? What do we want them to be?\n\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, color = Subject)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  theme_linedraw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Changing variable classes & plotting\nLet’s finalize sleep_long by mutating the Subject variable to be a factor (categorical) and the day variable to be numeric (quantitative). Take note of the mutate() code! You’ll use this type of code a lot.\n\n# a &lt;fctr&gt; is a categorical value, previously the 308s, 310s where being taken as quantitative values. Day was recorded as &lt;chr&gt; and we should make it a quantitative value &lt;dbl&gt;\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject), day = as.numeric(day))\n\n# Check it out\n# Same data, different class\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject   day reaction_time\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 308         0          250.\n2 308         1          259.\n3 308         2          251.\n4 308         3          321.\n5 308         4          357.\n6 308         5          415.\n\n\nPart a\nNow make some plots.\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on the same frame\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, color = Subject)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  theme_linedraw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on separate frames (one per subject)\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, color= Subject)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  facet_wrap(~Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize what you learned from the plots. For example:\n\nWhat’s the general relationship between reaction time and sleep?\nIs this the same for everybody? What differs?\nExercise 4: Pivot wider\nMake the data wide again, with each day becoming its own column.\nPart a\nAdjust the code below. What don’t you like about the column labels?\n\n# sleep_long |&gt;\n#   pivot_wider(names_from = ___, values_from = ___) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\nPart b\nUsing your intuition, adjust your code from part a to name the reaction time columns “day_0”, “day_1”, etc.\n\n# sleep_long |&gt;\n#   pivot_wider(names_from = ___, values_from = ___, names_prefix = \"___\") |&gt; \n#   head()\n\nExercise 5: Practice with Billboard charts\nLoad data on songs that hit the billboard charts around the year 2000. Included for each song is the artist name, track name, the date it hit the charts (date.enter), and wk-related variables that indicate rankings in each subsequent week on the charts:\n\n# Load data\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndata(\"billboard\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(billboard)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 79\n  artist      track date.entered   wk1   wk2   wk3   wk4   wk5   wk6   wk7   wk8\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2 Pac       Baby… 2000-02-26      87    82    72    77    87    94    99    NA\n2 2Ge+her     The … 2000-09-02      91    87    92    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n3 3 Doors Do… Kryp… 2000-04-08      81    70    68    67    66    57    54    53\n4 3 Doors Do… Loser 2000-10-21      76    76    72    69    67    65    55    59\n5 504 Boyz    Wobb… 2000-04-15      57    34    25    17    17    31    36    49\n6 98^0        Give… 2000-08-19      51    39    34    26    26    19     2     2\n# ℹ 68 more variables: wk9 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk10 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk11 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk12 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk13 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk14 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk15 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk16 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk17 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk18 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk19 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk20 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk21 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk22 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk23 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk24 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk25 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk26 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk27 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk28 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk29 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk30 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk31 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk32 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk33 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk34 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk35 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk36 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk37 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk38 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk39 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk40 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk41 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk42 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   wk43 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk44 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk45 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk46 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk47 &lt;dbl&gt;, wk48 &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nIn using this data, you’ll need to determine if and when the data needs to be reshaped for the task at hand.\nPart a\nConstruct and summarize a plot of how a song’s Billboard ranking its 2nd week on the chart (y-axis) is related to its ranking the 1st week on the charts (x-axis). Add a reference line geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1). Songs above this line improved their rankings from the 1st to 2nd week.\nPart b\nUse your wrangling tools to identify which songs are those above the line in Part a, i.e. with rankgings that went up from week 1 to week 2.\nPart c\nDefine a new dataset, nov_1999, which:\n\nonly includes data on songs that entered the Billboard charts on November 6, 1999\nkeeps all variables except track and date.entered. HINT: How can you avoid writing out all the variable names you want to keep?\n\n\n# Define nov_1999\n\n\n# Confirm that nov_1999 has 2 rows (songs) and 77 columns\n\nPart d\nCreate and discuss a visualization of the rankings (y-axis) over time (x-axis) for the 2 songs in nov_1999. There are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHints:\n\nShould you first pivot wider or longer?\nOnce you pivot, the week number is turned into a character variable. How can you change it to a number?\nExercise 6: Practice with the Daily Show\nThe data associated with this article is available in the fivethirtyeight package, and is loaded into daily below. It includes a list of every guest to ever appear on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show, a “late-night talk and satirical news” program (per Wikipedia). Check out the dataset and note that when multiple people appeared together, each person receives their own line:\n\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\ndata(\"daily_show_guests\")\ndaily &lt;- daily_show_guests\n\nIn analyzing this data, you’ll need to determine if and when the data needs to be reshaped.\nPart a\nIdentify the 15 guests that appeared the most. (This isn’t a very diverse guest list!)\nPart b\nCHALLENGE: Create the following data set containing 19 columns:\n\nThe first column should have the 15 guests with the highest number of total appearances on the show, listed in descending order of number of appearances.\n17 columns should show the number of appearances of the corresponding guest in each year from 1999 to 2015 (one per column).\nAnother column should show the total number of appearances for the corresponding guest over the entire duration of the show.\n\nThere are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHINTS: There are lots of ways to do this. You don’t necessarily need all of these hints.\n\nFirst obtain the number of times a guest appears each year.\nAdd a new column which includes the total number of times a guest appears across all years.\nPivot (longer or wider?). When you do, use values_fill = 0 to replace NA values with 0.\nArrange, then and keep the top 15.\nPart c\nLet’s recreate the first figure from the article. This groups all guests into 3 broader occupational categories. However, our current data has 18 categories:\n\ndaily |&gt; \n  count(group)\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n   group              n\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Academic         103\n 2 Acting           930\n 3 Advocacy          24\n 4 Athletics         52\n 5 Business          25\n 6 Clergy             8\n 7 Comedy           150\n 8 Consultant        18\n 9 Government        40\n10 Media            751\n11 Military          16\n12 Misc              45\n13 Musician         123\n14 Political Aide    36\n15 Politician       308\n16 Science           28\n17 media              5\n18 &lt;NA&gt;              31\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that includes a new variable, broad_group, that buckets these 18 categories into the 3 bigger ones used in the article. And get rid of any rows missing information on broad_group. You’ll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\nplot_data &lt;- daily |&gt; \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n\nNow, using the broad_group variable in plot_data, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You’ll have to wrangle the data first.",

I agree with the 90% – data wrangling isn’t something we have to do before we can do data science, it is data science! But let’s rethink the 10% – data wrangling is a fun and empowering puzzle!\n\nThe goals of data wrangling are to explore how to:\n\nGet data into the tidy shape / format we need for analysis. For example, we might want to:\n\nkeep only certain observations\ndefine new variables\nreformat or “clean” existing variables\ncombine various datasets\nprocess “string” or text data\n\n\nNumerically (not just visually) explore and summarize various characteristics of the variables in our dataset.",

    "text": "16.4 Warm-Up\nThere are lots and lots of steps that can go into data wrangling, thus lots and lots of relevant R functions. BUT just 6 functions can get us very far. People refer to these as the 6 main wrangling verbs or functions:\n\nwhy “verbs”? in the tidyverse grammar, functions serve as action words\n\nthe 6 verbs are all stored in the dplyr package within the tidyverse\n\neach verb acts on a data frame and returns a data frame\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\narrange\n\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\n\nfilter\n\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\n\nselect\n\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\n\nmutate\n\nmutate or create a column\n\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\n\ngroup_by\n\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.1 Example 1\nWhich verb would help us…\n\nkeep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc)\nget only the data on Minnesota\ndefine a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16\nsort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support\ndetermine the total number of votes cast across all counties\n\n16.4.2 Example 2: Select Columns\nTo get a sense for the code structure, let’s explore a couple verbs together. To start, let’s simplify our dataset to include only some variables of interest. Specifically, select() only the columns relevant to state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support:\n\n# What's the first argument- elections. The second- column\nselect(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))\n\nLet’s re-do this with the pipe function |&gt;:\n\nelections |&gt;\n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Function |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; “passes” objects, usually datasets, to a function:\nobject |&gt; function() is the same as function(object)\n\n\n\n16.4.3 Example 3: Filter Rows\nLet’s filter() out only the rows related to Minnesota (MN):\n\n# Without a pipe\nfilter(elections, state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With a pipe\nelections |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== vs =\n\n\n\nWe use a == b to check whether a matches b.\nWe use a = b to define that a is equal to b. We typically use = for this purpose inside a function, and &lt;- for this purpose outside a function.\n\n# Ex: \"=\" defines x\nx = 2\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# Ex: \"==\" checks whether x is/matches 3\nx == 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.4 Example 4: Filter and Select\nLet’s combine select() and filter() to create a new dataset with info about the county names, and 2020 and 2016 Democratic support among Minnesota counties.\n\n# Without pipes\nfilter(select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)), state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: all verbs in 1 row-n \nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: each verb in a new row- Better\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# We can even do this with UN-tidyverse code in \"base\" R\nelections[elections$state_name == \"Minnesota\", c(1, 4, 8, 12)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nWhy will we typically use:\n\ntidyverse code\nthe pipe function |&gt;\n\neach verb on a new row\n\n\n\n\n16.4.5 Example 5: Order of Operations\nSometimes, the order of operations matters, eg, putting on socks then shoes produces a different result than putting on shoes then socks. However, sometimes order doesn’t matter, eg, pouring cereal into a bowl then adding milk produces the same result as pouring milk into a bow then adding cereal (though one order is obviously better than the other ;)) Above (also copied below), we selected some columns and then filtered some rows:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\nWould we get the same result if we reversed select() and filter()? Think first, then try it.\n\n# Try it\n\n\n16.4.6 Example 6: Storing Results\nTypically:\n\nWe want to store our data wrangling results.\nIt’s good practice to do so under a new name. We want to preserve, thus don’t want to overwrite, the original data (especially if our code contains errors!!).\n\n\n# Store the results\nmn &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n# Always check it out to confirm it's what you want it to be!\nhead(mn)\n\n  state_name      county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16\n1  Minnesota    Aitkin County      35.98      34.12\n2  Minnesota     Anoka County      47.79      41.01\n3  Minnesota    Becker County      33.96      30.47\n4  Minnesota  Beltrami County      47.24      40.76\n5  Minnesota    Benton County      32.70      28.33\n6  Minnesota Big Stone County      35.41      33.75\n\nnrow(mn)\n\n[1] 87\n\nnrow(elections)\n\n[1] 3109",

To this end, we must:\n\nIdentify the variable(s) that are relevant to the filter.\n\nUse a “logical comparison operator” to define which values of the variable to keep:\n\n\nsymbol\nmeaning\n\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n%in% c(???, ???)\na list of multiple values\n\n\n\n\nUse quotes \"\" when specifying outcomes of interest for a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties in Hawaii\nelections_small |&gt;\n  filter(state_name == \"Hawaii\")\n\n  state_name     county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1     Hawaii   Hawaii County          87814        30.63      66.88\n2     Hawaii Honolulu County         382114        35.66      62.51\n3     Hawaii    Kauai County          33497        34.58      63.36\n4     Hawaii     Maui County          71044        31.14      66.59\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1          64865      63.61\n2         285683      61.48\n3          26335      62.49\n4          51942      64.45\n\n\n\n# What does this do? # Keep counties in Hawaii AND Delaware\nelections_small |&gt; \n filter(state_name %in% c(\"Hawaii\", \"Delaware\"))\n\n  state_name       county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1   Delaware       Kent County          87025        47.12      51.19\n2   Delaware New Castle County         287633        30.72      67.81\n3   Delaware     Sussex County         129352        55.07      43.82\n4     Hawaii     Hawaii County          87814        30.63      66.88\n5     Hawaii   Honolulu County         382114        35.66      62.51\n6     Hawaii      Kauai County          33497        34.58      63.36\n7     Hawaii       Maui County          71044        31.14      66.59\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1          74253      44.91\n2         261468      62.30\n3         105814      37.17\n4          64865      63.61\n5         285683      61.48\n6          26335      62.49\n7          51942      64.45\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got MORE THAN 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# THINK: What variable is relevant here?\nelections_small %&gt;% \n  filter(repub_pct_20 &gt; 93.97)\n\n  state_name    county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1      Texas  Borden County            416        95.43       3.85\n2      Texas    King County            159        94.97       5.03\n3      Texas Roberts County            550        96.18       3.09\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1            365       8.49\n2            159       3.14\n3            550       3.64\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got AT LEAST 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# This should have 1 more row (observation) than your answer above\nelections_small %&gt;% \n  filter(repub_pct_20 &gt;= 93.97)\n\n  state_name     county_name total_votes_20 repub_pct_20 dem_pct_20\n1    Montana Garfield County            813        93.97       5.04\n2      Texas   Borden County            416        95.43       3.85\n3      Texas     King County            159        94.97       5.03\n4      Texas  Roberts County            550        96.18       3.09\n  total_votes_16 dem_pct_16\n1            715       4.76\n2            365       8.49\n3            159       3.14\n4            550       3.64\n\n\nWe can also filter with respect to 2 rules!

Let’s practice combining these into pipe series. Here are some hot tips:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the prompt: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time – don’t try writing a whole chunk at once.\n\nPart a\nShow just the counties in Minnesota and their Democratic 2020 vote percentage, from highest to lowest. Your answer should have just 2 columns.\nPart b\nCreate a new dataset named mn_wi that sorts the counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin from lowest to highest in terms of the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016. This dataset should include the following variables (and only these variables): state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, and a variable measuring the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016.\n\n# Define the dataset\n# Only store the results once you're confident that they're correct\n\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your results\n\nPart c\nConstruct and discuss a plot of the county-level change in Democratic vote percent in 2020 vs 2016, and how this differs between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\nExercise 7: summarize Demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nLet’s talk about the last 2 verbs. summarize() (or equivalently summarise()) takes an entire data frame as input and outputs a single row with one or more summary statistics. For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20))\n\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name)\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   class()\n# \n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   class()\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# What does this do?\n# (What if we didn't use group_by?)\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble! But the units of observation are now states instead of counties within states.\n\n\nExercise 9: DIY\nLet’s practice (some of) our 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by Remember:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the given prompts: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time.\n\nPart a\nNOTE: Part a is a challenge exercise. If you get really stuck, move on to Part b which is the same overall question, but with hints.\n\n# Sort the *states* from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each *state*?\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n\nPart b\n\n# Sort the states from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n# HINT: Calculate the total number of votes in each state, then sort\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each state?\n# HINT: First calculate the number of Dem and Repub votes in each *county*\n# Then group and summarize these by state\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n# HINT: Start with the results from the previous chunk, and then keep only some rows\n\nExercise 10: Practice on New Data\nRecall the World Cup football/soccer data from TidyTuesday:\n\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nYou can find a codebook here. Use (some of) our 6 verbs (select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by) and data viz to address the following prompts.\n\n# In what years did Brazil win the World Cup?\n\n\n# What were the 6 World Cups with the highest attendance?\n\n\n# Construct a univariate plot of goals_scored (no wrangling necessary)\n# This provides a visual summary of how the number of goals_scored varies from World Cup to World Cup\n\n\n# Let's follow up the plot with some more precise numerical summaries\n# Calculate the min, median, and max number of goals_scored across all World Cups\n# NOTE: Visually compare these numerical summaries to what you observed in the plot\n\n\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the number of goals_scored in the World Cup has changed over the years\n# No wrangling necessary\n\n\n# Our above summaries might be a bit misleading.\n# The number of games played at the World Cup varies.\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the typical number of goals per game has changed over the years\n\nExercise 11: Practice on Your Data\nReturn to the TidyTuesday data you’re using in Homework 3.

    "text": "Data Science Process\nBelow is the visual representation of the data science process we saw earlier. Which stage are we in currently?\n\nRecall that wrangling is important. It is much of what we spend our efforts on in Data Science. There are lots of steps, hence R functions, that can go into data wrangling. But we can get far with the following 6 wrangling verbs:\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\narrange\n\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\n\nfilter\n\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\n\nselect\n\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\n\nmutate\n\nmutate or create a column\n\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\n\ngroup_by\n\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\nExample 1: Single Verb\nLet’s start by working with some TidyTuesday data on penguins. This data includes information about penguins’ flippers (“arms”) and bills (“mouths” or “beaks”). Let’s import this using read_csv(), a function in the tidyverse package.

The right approach depends upon your research goals. A general rule is: Only get rid of observations with missing data if they’re missing data on variables you need for the specific task at hand!\n\n\nExample 1\nSuppose our research focus is just on body_mass_g. Two penguins are missing this info:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(body_mass_g))`\n                      &lt;int&gt;\n1                         2\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that removes these penguins:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins_w_body_mass &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) # not is.na\n\n# Compare the number of penguins in this vs the original data\nnrow(penguins_w_body_mass)\n\n[1] 342\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nNote that some penguins in penguins_w_body_mass are missing info on sex, but we don’t care since that’s not related to our research question:\n\npenguins_w_body_mass |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(sex)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(sex))`\n              &lt;int&gt;\n1                 9\n\n\nExample 2\nIn the very rare case that we need complete information on every variable for the specific task at hand, we can use na.omit() to get rid of any penguin that’s missing info on any variable:\n\npenguins_complete &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\nHow many penguins did this eliminate?\n\nnrow(penguins_complete)\n\n[1] 333\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nPart c\nExplain why we should only use na.omit() in extreme circumstances.\n because each observation of data, particularly when dealing with a lot of data is likely to have some missing info\nExercise 2: More Selecting\nBeing able to select() only certain columns can help simplify our data. This is especially important when we’re working with lots of columns (which we haven’t done yet). It can also get tedious to type out every column of interest. Here are some shortcuts:\n\n\n- removes a given variable and keeps all others (e.g. select(-island))\n\nstarts_with(\"___\"), ends_with(\"___\"), or contains(\"___\") selects only the columns that either start with, end with, or simply contain the given string of characters\n\nUse these shortcuts to create the following datasets.\n\n# First: recall the variable names\nnames(penguins)\n\n[1] \"species\"           \"island\"            \"bill_length_mm\"   \n[4] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"flipper_length_mm\" \"body_mass_g\"      \n[7] \"sex\"               \"year\"             \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep everything but the year and island variables\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(-year, -island)\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 6\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   \n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181        3750 male  \n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186        3800 female\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195        3250 female\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA          NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193        3450 female\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190        3650 male  \n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181        3625 female\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195        4675 male  \n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193        3475 &lt;NA&gt;  \n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190        4250 &lt;NA&gt;  \n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the penguin characteristics measured in mm\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(species, ends_with(\"mm\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 4\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193\n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and bill-related measurements\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(species, starts_with(\"bill\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18  \n 4 Adelie            NA            NA  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1\n10 Adelie            42            20.2\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the length-related characteristics\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(species, contains(\"length\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3               195\n 4 Adelie            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1               193\n10 Adelie            42                 190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Arranging, Counting, & Grouping by Multiple Variables\nWe’ve done examples where we need to filter() by more than one variable, or select() more than one variable.

Dates are a whole special object type or class in R that automatically respect the order of time.\n\n# Get today's date\nas.Date(today())\n\n[1] \"2025-05-01\"\n\n# Let's store this as \"today\" so we can work with it below\ntoday &lt;- as.Date(today())\n\n# Check out the class of this object\nclass(today)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nThe lubridate package inside tidyverse contains functions that can extract various information from dates. Let’s learn about some of the most common functions by applying them to today. For each, make a comment on what the function does\n\nyear(today)\n\n[1] 2025\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n# month(today) tells us the monthn as a number of the 12\n# month(today, label = TRUE) = 1st 3 letters of the month/ as a label\nmonth(today)\n\n[1] 5\n\nmonth(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] May\n12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec\n\n\n\n# What does this number mean? \n#what week of the year are we\nweek(today)\n\n[1] 18\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference? \n# day of the month\n# Day number of the year\nmday(today)\n\n[1] 1\n\nyday(today)  # This is often called the \"Julian day\"\n\n[1] 121\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n#week day number, day name \nwday(today)\n\n[1] 5\n\nwday(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Thu\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\n\n\n# What do the results of these 2 lines tell us?\n# is today after 14 February 2024\n#is today before Feb 2024, returns a T or F\ntoday &gt;= ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntoday &lt; ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] FALSE",

Let’s apply these ideas to the daily Birthdays dataset in the mosaic package.\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\ndata(\"Birthdays\")\nhead(Birthdays)\n\n  state year month day       date wday births\n1    AK 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     14\n2    AL 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    174\n3    AR 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     78\n4    AZ 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     84\n5    CA 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    824\n6    CO 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    100\n\n\nBirthdays gives the number of births recorded on each day of the year in each state from 1969 to 19881. We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line.

For example:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(species != \"Gentoo\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + \n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the total number of births in each month and year, eg, Jan 1969, Feb 1969, …. Label month by names not numbers, eg, Jan not 1. Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn.\n\n# Either this one \nmonthly_births &lt;- Birthdays |&gt;\n  mutate(month_name = month.abb[month]) |&gt;  \n  group_by(year, month_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(total_births = sum(births), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(month_name = factor(month_name, levels = month.abb))\n  \n  #View(monthly_births)\n\nggplot(monthly_births, aes(x = month_name, y = total_births)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Births by Month (Across All Years)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it!\nExercise 8: More Practice\nPart a\nCreate a dataset with only births in Massachusetts (MA) in 1979 and sort the days from those with the most births to those with the fewest.\nPart b\nMake a table showing the five states with the most births between September 9, 1979 and September 12, 1979, including the 9th and 12th. Arrange the table in descending order of births.",

    "text": "18.2 Data Import\nStarting Data Project\nAny data science project consists of two phases:\n\n\nData Collection\nA data project starts with data! Thus far, you’ve either been given data, or used TidyTuesday data. In this unit:\n\nWe WILL explore how to find data, save data, import this data into RStudio, and do some preliminary data cleaning.\nWe will NOT discuss how to collect data from scratch (e.g. via experiment, observational study, or survey).\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nOnce we have data, we need to do some analysis. In this unit…\n\nWe WILL bring together our wrangling & visualization tools to discuss exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is the process of getting to know our data, obtaining insights from data, and using these insights to formulate, refine, and explore research questions.\nWe will NOT explore other types of analysis, such as modeling & prediction–if interested, take STAT 155 and 253 to learn more about these topics.\n\n\n\nNOTE: These skills are best learned through practice. We’ll just scratch the surface here.\nFile Formats\nBefore exploring how to find, store, import, check, and clean data, it’s important to recognize that data can be stored in various formats. We’ve been working with .csv files. In the background, these have “comma-separated values” (csv):\n\nBut there are many other common file types. For example, the following are compatible with R:\n\nExcel files: .xls, .xlsx\n\nR “data serialization” files: .rds\n\nfiles with tab-separated values: .tsv\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: Find Data\nCheck the Datasets page for information about how to find a dataset that fits your needs.\nSTEP 2: Save Data Locally\nUnless we’re just doing a quick, one-off data analysis, it’s important to store a local copy of a data file, i.e. save the data file to our own machine.\nMainly, we shouldn’t rely on another person / institution to store a data file online, in the same place, forever!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations when Saving Data\n\n\n\nWhen saving your data, make sure they are\n\nin a nice format, eg, a csv file format\nwhere you’ll be able to find it again\nideally, within a folder that’s dedicated to the related project / assignment\nalongside the qmd file(s) where you’ll record your analysis of the data\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: Import Data to RStudio\nOnce we have a local copy of our data file, we need to get it into RStudio! This process depends on 2 things: (1) the file type (e.g. .csv); and (2) the file location, i.e. where it’s stored on your computer.\n1. FILE TYPE\nThe file type indicates which function we’ll need to import it. The table below lists some common import functions and when to use them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nData file type\n\n\n\nread_csv()\n.csv - you can save Excel files and Google Sheets as .csv\n\n\nread_delim()\nother delimited formats (tab, space, etc.)\n\n\nread_sheet()\nGoogle Sheet\n\n\nst_read()\nspatial data shapefile\n\n\n\nNOTE: In comparison to read.csv, read_csv is faster when importing large data files and can more easily parse complicated datasets, eg, with dates, times, percentages.\n2. FILE LOCATION\nTo import the data, we apply the appropriate function from above to the file path.\nA file path is an address to where the file is stored on our computer or the web.\nConsider “1600 Grand Ave, St. Paul, MN 55105”. Think about how different parts of the address give increasingly more specific information about the location. “St. Paul, MN 55105” tells us the city and smaller region within the city, “Grand Ave” tells us the street, and “1600” tells us the specific location on the street.\nIn the example below, the file path is absolute where it tells us the location giving more and more specific information as you read it from left to right.\n\n“~”, on an Apple computer, tells you that you are looking in the user’s home directory.\n“Desktop” tells you to go to the Desktop within that home directory.\n“112” tells you that you are looking in the 112 folder on the Desktop.\n“data” tells you to next go in the data folder in the 112 folder.\n“my_data.csv” tells you that you are looking for a file called my_data.csv location within the data folder.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/112/data/my_data.csv\")\n\nAbsolute file paths should only be used when reading files hosted on the web. Otherwise, relative file paths should be used. Relative file paths as the name suggest is relative to the file where the data file is read.\n\n# assume the code containing this script is under a folder called /src which\n# is at the same level of the /data folder\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/my_data.csv\")\n\nSTEP 4: Check & Clean Data\nOnce the data is loaded, ask yourself a few questions:\nWhat’s the structure of the data?\n\nUse str() to learn about the numbers of variables and observations as well as the classes or types of variables (date, location, string, factor, number, boolean, etc.)\nUse head() to view the top of the data table\nUse View() to view the data in a spreadsheet-like viewer, use this command in the Console but don’t include it in your qmd files since it will prevent your project from rendering.\n\nIs there anything goofy that we need to clean before we can analyze the data?\n\nIs it in a tidy format?\nHow many rows are there? What does the row mean? What is an observation?\nIs there consistent formatting for categorical variables?\nIs there missing data that needs to be addressed?\nSTEP 5: Understand Data\nStart by understanding the data that is available to you. If you have a codebook, you have struck gold! If not (the more common case), you’ll need to do some detective work that often involves talking to people.\nAt this stage, ask yourself:\n\nWhere does my data come from? How was it collected?1\n\nIs there a codebook? If not, how can I learn more about it?\nAre there people I can reach out to who have experience with this data?",

    "text": "18.3 Exercises\nSuppose our goal is to work with data on movie reviews, and that we’ve already gone through the work to find a dataset. The imdb_5000_messy.csv file is posted on Moodle. Let’s work with it!\nExercise 1: Save Data Locally\nPart a\nOn your laptop:\n\nDownload the “imdb_5000_messy.csv” file from Moodle\nMove it to the data folder in your portfolio repository\nPart b\nHot tip: After saving your data file, it’s important to record appropriate citations and info in either a new qmd (eg: “imdb_5000_messy_README.qmd”) or in the qmd where you’ll analyze the data. These citations should include:\n\nthe data source, i.e. where you found the data\nthe data creator, i.e. who / what group collected the original data\npossibly a data codebook, i.e. descriptions of the data variables\n\nTo this end, check out where we originally got our IMDB data:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata\nAfter visiting that website, take some quick notes here on the data source and creator.\n\nimbd_5000_messy.cvs contains data fields from The Movie Database (TMDb) in accordance with their terms of use.\n\nExercise 2: Import Data to RStudio\nNow that we have a local copy of our data file, let’s get it into RStudio! Remember that this process depends on 2 things: the file type and location. Since our file type is a csv, we can import it using read_csv(). But we have to supply the file location through a file path. To this end, we can either use an absolute file path or a relative file path.\nPart a\nAn absolute file path describes the location of a file starting from the root or home directory. How we refer to the user root directory depends upon your machine:\n\nOn a Mac: ~\n\nOn Windows: typically C:\\\n\n\nThen the complete file path to the IMDB data file in the data folder, depending on your machine an where you created your portfolio project, can be:\n\nOn a Mac: ~/Desktop/portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: C:\\Desktop\\portfolio\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or C:\\\\Desktop\\\\portfolio\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate absolute file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_messy.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nimdb_messy &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/112/portfolio-mmunyaradzi/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\nPart b\nAbsolute file paths can get really long, depending upon our number of sub-folders, and they should not be used when sharing code with other and instead relative file paths should be used. A relative file path describes the location of a file from the current “working directory”, i.e. where RStudio would currently look for on your computer. Check what your working directory is inside this qmd:\n\n# This should be the folder where you stored this qmd!\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/munyaradzi/Desktop/112/portfolio-mmunyaradzi/ica\"\n\n\nNext, check what the working directory is for the console by typing getwd() in the console. This is probably different, meaning that the relative file paths that will work in your qmd won’t work in the console! You can either exclusively work inside your qmd, or change the working directory in your console, by navigating to the following in the upper toolbar: Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File location.\nPart c\nAs a good practice, we created a data folder and saved our data file (imdb_5000_messy.csv) into.\nSince our .qmd analysis and .csv data live in the same project, we don’t have to write out absolute file paths that go all the way to the root directory. We can use relative file paths that start from where our code file exists to where the data file exist:\n\nOn a Mac: ../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: ..\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or ..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nNOTE: .. means go up one level in the file hierarchy, ie, go to the parent folder/directory.\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate relative file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_temp (temp for “temporary”). Convince yourself that this worked, i.e. you get the same dataset as imdb_messy.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Paths\n\n\n\nAbsolute file paths should be used when referring to files hosed on the web, eg, https://mac-stat.github.io/data/kiva_partners2.csv. In all other instances, relative file paths should be used.\n\n\nPart d: OPTIONAL\nSometimes, we don’t want to import the entire dataset. For example, we might want to…\n\nskips some rows, eg, if they’re just “filler”\nonly import the first “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\nonly import a random subset of “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\n\nThe “data import cheat sheet” at the top of this qmd, or Google, are handy resources here. As one example…\n\n# Try importing only the first 5 rows\nread_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\", n_max = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1 Color James Cameron                        723      178\n2     2 Color Gore Verbinski                       302      169\n3     3 Color Sam Mendes                           602      148\n4     4 Color Christopher Nolan                    813      164\n5     5 &lt;NA&gt;  Doug Walker                           NA       NA\n# ℹ 24 more variables: director_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   actor_3_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_2_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, gross &lt;dbl&gt;, genres &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_name &lt;chr&gt;, movie_title &lt;chr&gt;, num_voted_users &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   cast_total_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_3_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   facenumber_in_poster &lt;dbl&gt;, plot_keywords &lt;chr&gt;, movie_imdb_link &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   num_user_for_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, language &lt;chr&gt;, country &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\nExercise 3: Check Data\nAfter importing new data into RStudio, you MUST do some quick checks of the data. Here are two first steps that are especially useful.\nPart a\nOpen imdb_messy in the spreadsheet-like viewer by typing View(imdb_messy) in the console. Sort this “spreadsheet” by different variables by clicking on the arrows next to the variable names. Do you notice anything unexpected?\nPart b\nDo a quick summary() of each variable in the dataset.

Is there anything you’d need to clean before using this data?\nExercise 4: Clean Data: Factor Variables 1\nIf you didn’t already in Exercise 3, check out the color variable in the imdb_messy dataset.\n\nWhat’s goofy about this / what do we need to fix?\nMore specifically, what different categories does the color variable take, and how many movies fall into each of these categories?\n\n\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  color               n\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1 B&W                10\n2 Black and White   199\n3 COLOR              30\n4 Color            4755\n5 color              30\n6 &lt;NA&gt;               19\n\n\nExercise 5: Clean Data: Factor Variables 2\nWhen working with categorical variables like color, the categories must be “clean”, i.e. consistent and in the correct format. Let’s make that happen.\nPart a\nWe could open the .csv file in, say, Excel or Google sheets, clean up the color variable, save a clean copy, and then reimport that into RStudio. BUT that would be the wrong thing to do. Why is it important to use R code, which we then save inside this qmd, to clean our data?\n\nThe R code is reproducible\n\nPart b\nLet’s use R code to change the color variable so that it appropriately combines the various categories into only 2: Color and Black_White. We’ve learned a couple sets of string-related tools that could be handy here. First, starting with the imdb_messy data, change the color variable using one of the functions we learned in the Factors lesson.\nfct_relevel(), fct_recode(), fct_reorder()\nStore your results in imdb_temp (don’t overwrite imdb_messy). To check your work, print out a count() table of the color variable in imdb_temp.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(color = fct_recode(color,\n                            \"Color\" = \"COLOR\",\n                            \"Color\" = \"color\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"B&W\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"Black and White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat Part b using one of our string functions from the String lesson:\nstr_replace(), str_replace_all(), str_to_lower(), str_sub(), str_length(), str_detect()\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(color = str_replace(color, \"COLOR\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"color\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"B&W\", \"Black_White\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"Black and White\", \"Black_White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nExercise 6: Clean Data: Missing Data 1\nThroughout these exercises, you’ve probably noticed that there’s a bunch of missing data. This is encoded as NA (not available) in R. There are a few questions to address about missing data:\n\n\nHow many values are missing data? What’s the volume of the missingness? 19\n\nWhy are some values missing?\n\nWhat should we do about the missing values?\n\nLet’s consider the first 2 questions in this exercise.\nPart a\nAs a first step, let’s simply understand the volume of NAs. Specifically:\n\n# Count the total number of rows in imdb_messy\ncount(imdb_messy)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      n\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1  5043\n\n# Then count the number of NAs in each column\ncolSums(is.na(imdb_messy))\n\n                     ...1                     color             director_name \n                        0                        19                       104 \n   num_critic_for_reviews                  duration   director_facebook_likes \n                       50                        15                       104 \n   actor_3_facebook_likes              actor_2_name    actor_1_facebook_likes \n                       23                        13                         7 \n                    gross                    genres              actor_1_name \n                      884                         0                         7 \n              movie_title           num_voted_users cast_total_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n             actor_3_name      facenumber_in_poster             plot_keywords \n                       23                        13                       153 \n          movie_imdb_link      num_user_for_reviews                  language \n                        0                        21                        12 \n                  country            content_rating                    budget \n                        5                       303                       492 \n               title_year    actor_2_facebook_likes                imdb_score \n                      108                        13                         0 \n             aspect_ratio      movie_facebook_likes \n                      329                         0 \n\n# Then count the number of NAs in a specific column\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  filter((is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  4503 Color Léa Pool                              23       97\n2  4520 Color Harry Gantz                           12      105\n3  4721 Color U.

Study the individual observations with NAs carefully. Why do you think they are missing? Are certain films more likely to have more NAs than others?\nPart c\nConsider a more specific example. Obtain a dataset of movies that are missing data on actor_1_facebook_likes. Then explain why you think there are NAs.

There is no perfect or universal approach here. Rather, we must think carefully about…\n\nWhy the values are missing?\nWhat we want to do with our data?\nWhat is the impact of removing or replacing missing data on our work / conclusions?\n\nPart a\nCalculate the average duration of a film. THINK: How can we deal with the NA’s?\n\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  summarize(mean(duration, na.rm = T))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `mean(duration, na.rm = T)`\n                        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                        107.\n\n\nFollow-up:\nHow are the NAs dealt with here? Did we have to create and save a new dataset in order to do this analysis?\n\nJust use the na.rm = True no need to create a new dataset\n\nPart b\nTry out the drop_na() function:\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- drop_na(imdb_messy)\nnrow(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 3756\n\n\nFollow-up questions:\n\nWhat did drop_na() do? How many data points are left? -3756 observations left\nIn what situations might this function be a good idea?\nIn what situations might this function be a bad idea? It’s a good idea when we need complete info on every variable for every part of our analysis. It’s not a good idea in that many observations may be lost.\nPart c\ndrop_na() removes data points that have any NA values, even if we don’t care about the variable(s) for which data is missing. This can result in losing a lot of data points that do have data on the variables we actually care about! For example, suppose we only want to explore the relationship between film duration and whether it’s in color. Check out a plot:\n\nggplot(imdb_messy, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nCreate a new dataset with only and all movies that have complete info on duration and color. HINT: You could use !is.na(___) or drop_na() (differently than above)\nUse this new dataset to create a new and improved plot.\nHow many movies remain in your new dataset? Hence why this is better than using the dataset from part b? -more movies are kept\n\n\n# using drop_na()\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  select(duration, color) |&gt; \n  drop_na()\ndim(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 5010    2\n\n# using !is.na()\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(duration), !is.na(color))\ndim(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 5010   29\n\n# plot for imbq_temp\nggplot(imdb_temp, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nIn some cases, missing data is more non-data than unknown data. For example, the films with NAs for actor_1_facebook_likes actually have 0 Facebook likes–they don’t even have actors! In these cases, we can replace the NAs with a 0. Use the replace_na() function to create a new dataset (imdb_temp) that replaces the NAs in actor_1_facebook_likes with 0. You’ll have to check out the help file for this function.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(actor_1_facebook_likes =\n         replace_na(actor_1_facebook_likes, 0))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes))`\n                                 &lt;int&gt;\n1                                    0\n\n\nExercise 8: New Data + Projects\nLet’s practice the above ideas while also planting some seeds for the course project. Each group will pick and analyze their own dataset. The people you’re sitting with today aren’t necessarily your project groups! BUT do some brainstorming together:\n\nShare with each other: What are some personal hobbies or passions or things you’ve been thinking about or things you’d like to learn more about? Don’t think too hard about this! Just share what’s at the top of mind today.\nEach individual: Find a dataset online that’s related to one of the topics you shared in the above prompt.\nDiscuss what data you found with your group!\nLoad the data into RStudio, perform some basic checks, and perform some preliminary cleaning, as necessary.",

All cases during a specific time frame? All data for a selected set of users?, when: Is this current data? Historical? What events may have had an impact?, what: What variables were measured? How was it measured? Self-reported through a questionnaire? Directly?, why: Who funded the data collection? What was the purposes? To whose benefit was the data collected? Answers to such questions strongly impact the conclusions you will be able to draw from the data.↩︎",
