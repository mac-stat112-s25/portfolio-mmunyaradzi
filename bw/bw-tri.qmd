title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
choc <- read.csv("../data/Chocolate Sales.csv")
#View(choc)
```

```{r}
#convert amount to numeric, remove $ and commas
choc$Amount <- as.numeric(gsub("[$,]", "", choc$Amount))


# Plot 
ggplot(choc, aes(x = Boxes.Shipped, y = Amount)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size= 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ Country) +
  labs(title = "Sales Amount Over and Boxes Shipped",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Sales Amount ($)",
       size = "Boxes Shipped",
       color = "Sales Person") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se= F, color= "red" ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
