title: "Quadvariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
spotify <- read.csv("../data/light_spotify_dataset.csv")
head(spotify)
```

```{r}
# spotify_sample for fast plotting.
spotify_sample <- spotify %>% sample_n(50)


ggplot(spotify_sample, aes(x = Tempo, y = Loudness, color = emotion, size = variance)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "D") +
  facet_wrap(~ Genre) +
  labs(
    title = "Spotify Quadvisualization: Tempo, Loudness, Emotion, Variance by Genre",
    x = "Tempo (BPM)",
    y = "Loudness (dB)",
    color = "Emotion",
    size = "Variance"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
