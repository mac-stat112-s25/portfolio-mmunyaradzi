Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
rev <- read.csv("../data/netflix_revenue_updated.csv")
```

```{r}
#bivariate plot
ggplot(rev, aes(x = UCAN.Members/1e6, y = Global.Revenue/1e9)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "darkblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between UCAN Members and Global Revenue",
    x = "UCAN Members (Millions)",
    y = "Global Revenue (Billions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
